start the game (also clear up the set in redis which stores the list of all group names taken, to ensure no two groups have same name, just after the game starts. Also ensure that until all groups are not created, game cannot start)

finish the game (auto-finishes, but still handle it properly)

allocate extra points to each team depending upon the level reached

Add a feature to disqualify a group (If a group is disqualified, its records and its members records still remains in the Database, only the status is updated from 'active' to 'disqualified')

Add a special case group (by super-admin only). Like when participant form group -> the group should have members of four unique genres. now there can be cases where there are 3, 2 or 5 members, in that case a special group is formed not by participant but by super-admin, where he can create group of any number of members, and give them their initial points accordingly
